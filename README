Requirements
------------

This is easiest to compile on a Linux system, but you can probably
make it work with Windows. 

On Debian, you want the following packages installed: 
biblatex biber beamer texlive texlive-fonts-extra

Basic compilation: 

cd tmp
pdflatex ../2015-10-28-howto-win-pr.tex
biber 2015-10-18-howto-win-pr
pdflatex ../2015-10-28-howto-win-pr.tex
pdflatex ../2015-10-28-howto-win-pr.tex


### Spooky Font

The spooky font is "Green Fuz" from Larabie fonts. You can run the 
script in addfont/ to register it if you have the "greenfuz.ttf" file
in that folder. In Debian, you can find this font in the non-free
repository: 

fonts-larabie-uncommon: /usr/share/fonts/truetype/larabie/greenfuz.ttf

(Yes, the font is non-free, but it is offered pretty liberally.)
